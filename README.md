# 🤖 Candidate Recommendation Bot for Slack – nformal Sr. Technical Consultant Challenge

This project provides an automated solution for recommending top job candidates using Eightfold match scores, summarizing their fit and gaps, and posting structured messages into a Slack channel. It was developed as part of the **nformal Technical Consultant / SA Challenge**.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

You are working for a recruiting firm using Eightfold to source candidates for various open roles. The goal is to:

- Select the **top 2 candidates** per position based on match score.
- Post this information to a designated **Slack channel**.
- Include a **rationale for candidate fit**, the **match score**, and **explanation for non-perfect scores**.

## 🧠 Eightfold Matching Overview

Eightfold assigns a **match score from 0 to 5** for each candidate-position pair, based on:

- Skills (acquired/inferred)
- Job titles and seniority
- Location and distance/remoteness
- Education, experience
- Similarity to ideal candidates

---

## 📤 Expected Slack Message

Each message should include:

- 🎯 **Position Title & Location**
- 🧑‍💼 Top 2 Candidates (name, location, profile link, resume link)
- 📈 Match Score
- ✅ Reasons why they are a great fit
- ⚠️ Explanation for any score less than 5
